Lox interpreter written in Go (WIP)

Golang implementation of the first half of [crafting interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html) is in progress, 
currently at 12.Classes. Code from previous chapters hasn't been organized yet, so I've temporarily placed the recent code here. 
Part III.A Bytecode Virtual Machine is also on my roadmap.‌
